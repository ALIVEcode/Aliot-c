## Folder Structure

The workspace contains four important folders by default:

- `src`: the folder where you find the entry point of your application (main.cpp).
- `lib`: the folder where you find the Aliot-c library.
- `include`: the folder containing all the global header files.
- `test`: the folder containing the unit tests for the Aliot-c library.
